The [Astartup Cookbookâ„¢](github.com/a-startup/astartup.cookbook) is an open-source book on how to invent, launch, and run a modern startup with I am You Language (IMUL). The Astartup, or A* Startup, is a productivity technique developed by Cale McCollough that integrates your pen-and-paper development logs with your computer and A* Startup Network.

The cookbook skelton is pretty well outlined and there is about 100 pages so far but there is a lot of work left to do. The demo projects in this book walk you through inventing a product through end of life using I am You Language (IMUL) using the [Oregon-Cooler](oregoncooler.org) as an example.
