The [Greentech Cookbookâ„¢](https://github.com/oregon-cooler/greentech.cookbook) is an open-source book that teaches how to make Oregon-Coolers to combat global warming. The [Oregon-Cooler](oregoncooler.org) is an open-source green water heater, solar power station, HVAC, and smart-home system.

This is a very new cookbook and it doesn't have much work or even a skeleton, but it's a FREAKING AWESOME IDEA!!! The demo projects in this cookbook are an extension of the [KabukiPress Cookbook](kabukipress-cookbook), an open-source book on how to make intelligent connected services, apps, websites, and books with Modern Embedded-C++, Script2, and I am You Language (IMUL). These technologies serve as the foundation of the Oregon-Cooler smart-home system. The Cookbook adds the [Kabuki Tek Toolkit](github.com/kabuki-starship/kabuki.toolkit.tek) to create firmware using [mbed](mbed.com) and Script2.
