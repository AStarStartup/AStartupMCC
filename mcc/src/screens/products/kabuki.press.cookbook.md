The [KabukiPress Cookbook](github.com/kabuki-starship/kabuki.press.cookbook)™ is an open-source book on how to make intelligent connected services, apps, websites, and books with Modern Embedded-C++, Script2™, and I am You Language™ (IMUL™). This cookbook covers the entire process of creating a KabukiPress book, website, book app, and web service using [Script2](github.com/kabuki-starship/script2), [Kabuki Toolkit](github.com/kabuki-starship/kabuki.toolkit)™, and [KabukiPress](github.com/kabuki-starship/kabuki.press)™.

The demo projects for the cookbook are the Oregon-Cooler service, client app, Greentech Cookbook, and website, and it serves as the foundation of the [Greentech Cookbook](greentech-cookbook)™. You're looking at a VERY early version of this website, the products are very new, we don't have a lot of work done yet, and currently we're using Jekyll; but we have our own Script2, IMUL, and Embedded-C++ version of Jekyll to replace it that can import Jekyll sites.
